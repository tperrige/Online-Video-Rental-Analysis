# Online-Video-Rental-Analysis
Analyzing data about movie rentals and customers to answer business questions leading to the launch of an online video rental service.

In this project, I analyzed data from the fictional DVD rental company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, to help with their launch strategy for a new online video rental service. First, I loaded Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS), and then used SQL to analyze the data and answer complex business questions. Finally, I created visualizations of the results in Tableau and used them to make a presentation for the management team.

The data I used came from a fictional company, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, that included information about their film inventory, customers, payments, etc. It’s a sample database released by PostgreSQL Tutorial and can be accessed at:
